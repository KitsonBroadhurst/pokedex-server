# Pokedex Server

Following on from the Odyssey GraphQL + Apollo tutorial, building a Pokedex using the PokeAPI and adding a GraphQL layer over the top.

You can [find the course lessons and instructions on Odyssey](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/lift-off-part1), Apollo's learning platform.

You can [find the PokeAPI docs here.](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).

## How to use this repo

There are 2 main repos reqired:

- `server`: The starting point of our Apollo server application (this repo)
- `client`: please clone seperately

To get started:

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run dev`. (`npm start` is used in production)

This will start the GraphQL API server.
